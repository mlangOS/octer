octer
-- sidestepping read(1) limitations testing
---

---
Usage
-- oread [variable] < STDIN
---- oread reads STDIN then either sets [variable] to the result
---- or otherwise feeds it to STDOUT
-- exposed variables
---- `$octdump` contains the unchanged od(1) of STDIN
---- this can be used for advanced manipulations of raw data 
---

---
Proof of Concept
-- this is largely a poc showing that, with od (or even hexdump using %x)
-- its possible to sidestep the NUL variable limitation without malformed data
---- this will not receive actual usage, and was just for testing
---

---
Unicode support
-- currently ./uni-table-1993 contains all characters 
-- and their octal values of unicode version 1.1 (1993)
-- its likely possible to easily create a table version using a dump of
-- all of its characters, however I simply don't have time for this
